This repository contains a keymap for US keyboards that enables the following:

    AltGr+A -> ä
    AltGr+O -> ö
    AltGr+U -> ü
    AltGr+S -> š
    (plus the capitalized versions)

## X11 installation

Drop the file into `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols` (or the equivalent in your distro)

## Windows installation

Use the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator to compile the klc file or [download the compiled package](http://goo.gl/h7jTOJ).
